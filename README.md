## Introduction

Hi there, I'm Jonese, a certified beauty therapist who is enthusiastic about helping individuals feel and lookwhoÂ their best.
After graduating from the International Academy of Health and Skincare in 2007, I worked for several years at Placecol Beauty and the Lagoon Beach Hotel before embarking on my adventure.
What began as a little treatment room in my house has expanded into a large, fully furnished salon in Atlantis that serves as a haven where customers may unwind, receive pampering, and go feeling totally refreshed.
My family is the centre of my existence. I created Soul & Skin as a proud mother to strike a balance between my passion for beauty therapy and spending time with my kid.
My objective is to establish a calm, friendly space where each customer feels appreciated and comfortable.
I serve both men and women of all ages who value good self-care in a quiet, private environment. For people looking for profound relaxation, 
full-body grooming, and reasonably priced luxury without the hustle of a big salon, my treatments are ideal.
Soul & Skin is here for you whether you're a working woman, a busy father, a weary student, or just someone who needs a break.
