    <h3>Meet Jonese</h3>
    <p>Hey there, my name is Jonese, and I'm a licensed beauty therapist who's passionate about helping people feel and look their best. Prior to opening my home-based salon located here in Atlantis, I worked at Placecol Beauty and the Lagoon Beach Hotel after completing my studies at the International Academy of Health and Skincare in 2007.<br>
    What began as a tiny room in my house grew into a spacious, well-equipped area where my clients can come to unwind, receive pampering, and leave feeling rejuvenated.<br>
    Family is the core of everything I do. I am a proud mother, and I have structured my business to allow me to continue doing what I love while still being present for my daughter. My goal is to establish a serene, welcoming space where my clients feel valued and at ease.</p>
